\title{Look at genotypes that were imputed or changed by the HMM chain given a level of global genotypic error}
\usage{
plot_progeny_dosage_change(map_list, error, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{map_list}{a list of multiple \code{mappoly.map.list}}

\item{error}{error rate used in global error in the `calc_genoprob_error()`}

\item{verbose}{T or F for `calc_genoprob_error()` and `calc_homologprob()`}
}
\value{
A ggplot of the changed and imputed genotypic dosages
}
\description{
Outputs a graphical representation ggplot with the percent of data changed.
}
\details{
Most recent update 8/29/2023: 
   -fixed issue where only worked on tetraploid to now working for diploid to octaploid.
   -un-hardcoded linkage groups in maps. previously hard-coded for tetraploid rose.
}
\examples{
    x<-get_submap(solcap.err.map[[1]], 1:30, reestimate.rf = FALSE)
    plot_progeny_dosage_change(list(x), error=0.05)
